#For those just starting out, one suggested way to work on your code is to have a command window open and a text editor with this
#file loaded.  Make changes to this file and then run 'ruby part1.rb' at the command line, this will run your program.  Once you're
#satisfied with your work, save your file and upload it to the checker.
